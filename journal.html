        <p>Recently, the sequel to a game I like has come out. It's called Hollow Knight: Silksong, and I've been playing it every day since it was released. Last night, I finished "Act 1", which was very exciting (A lot of people who are better at games are already finished with the whole thing, but that's okay). in order to clear Act 1, I had to defeat a boss called the Last Judge. Her fight is a very cool one, but you need to get good at dodging all the fire she throws at you. I think it was my favourite fight in the whole first act, but the Lace and Widow fights were also very good.<br>Now, I'm in the second part of the game, which has a very different feel to it. The first part introduced lots of new things that weren't in Hollow Knight, but all the areas still felt like something that could be in the first game. The first real area in Act 2 is called the Underworks, and it feels completely different to everything else. It's not different in a bad way though, because I'm very excited to explore it. I can't believe how big the game is turning out to be.</p>
