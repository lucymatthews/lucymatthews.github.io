        <h2>Songs I Like</h2>
        <h4>Валюша- Ты Кошка</h4>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">I like when he says "кусь кусь немножко". "Немножко" means "a little" and "кусь кусь" is when cats do a friendly bite.</p>

        It seems your browser does not support the song, but you should definitely still listen to it somewhere else!</audio>
        <br><br><h4>VÆB- RÓA</h4>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">This song was in Eurovision this year (2025), and I thought it was very good, even though it came in 25th place out of 26.</p>

        <br><br><h4>Azawi- Gimme</h4>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">I used to listen to this album at work all the time when I was a barista. The job was stressful, but Azawi is S tier.</p>

        <br><br><h4>Гокки- Император</h4>
        <p style="font-size:12px;">I find a lot of neat Russian indie musicians on Spotify that I wouldn't have found otherwise, which I think is very cool (I feel the need to promote Spotify because I illegally ripped these songs from their platform).</p>
